// "When a numerical quantity designating how much or how many is assigned to each item in a
// sample, the resulting set of values is called numerical or quantitative. In some cases, sample
// items are placed into categories, and category names are assigned to the sample items. Then the
// data are categorical or qualitative. Example 1.8 provides an illustration." (TB)
